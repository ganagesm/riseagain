              <h3>Dismantling Prejudices and Promoting Inclusivity

              </h3>
              <p>Rise Again is committed to challenging and dismantling biases in the workforce. Our unique returnship, often referred to as a return-to-work program, offers a groundbreaking approach to career opportunities for individuals who have taken a career break. This disparity disproportionately affects women, who are frequently primary caregivers for their families and loved ones.
              </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the standard hiring processes employed by many companies tend to undervalue candidates with employment gaps on their resumes. Most Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and recruitment technologies fail to recognize the true potential and aptitude of these candidates.</p>
