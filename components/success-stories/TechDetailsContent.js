              <h2>Thriving in the New Workforce Landscape

              </h2>
              <p>The term ‘workforce’ has traditionally evoked images of direct employees, but its definition has undergone a profound transformation. Recent research reveals that more than 40% of the U.S. workforce is now engaged in non-traditional employment arrangements, including temporary, part-time, contract, and project-based roles.
              </p>
              <p> Contingent workers have assumed strategic positions within organizations, steering their career trajectories with increasing authority. Temporary employees often serve as a vital talent pipeline for future contract-to-hire conversions. This accentuates the need for companies to create avenues for the diverse recruitment of contingent and contract workers.

              <p>Women play a vital role in advancing diversity, and one remarkable but often underestimated source of talent lies in women who choose to ‘Return to Work’ after a career hiatus.
