              <p>Employees enjoy legal safeguards under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Qualified employees under FMLA are entitled to up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave. Following this period, employers must reinstate the employee to their previous position or a similar one. Specific regulations can vary by state and may be subject to collective bargaining agreements with employee unions. For an employee to be eligible for FMLA leave, they must have completed a minimum of 12 months of service and worked at least 1250 hours in the 12 months leading up to the leave.

              <p>Voluntary leave is more of an employee-centered perk rather than a mandated obligation. While it may not typically come with the same level of legal safeguards as mandatory leave, it serves as an indicator of your organization’s consideration for employees’ personal circumstances. Companies offering such leave should define specific criteria for eligibility, outlining who qualifies and who does not.

              <p>When employers demonstrate empathy by offering a voluntary leave program, they not only enhance employee loyalty but also elevate overall workforce morale.
